    <h1>The Lost Balloon</h1>
    <h2>By Appiffany Ellis</h2>
    <p>This animation is about a young boy who loses his balloon, and it pops, making him feel upset. I created it to highlight how trivial things can feel important to young people. It shows how small moments or objects, like a balloon, can have a big emotional impact on children and teens, even though adults might see them as insignificant. The story emphasizes how, for youth, these little experiences can shape their emotions and perceptions of the world around them.</p>
